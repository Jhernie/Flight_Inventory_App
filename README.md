# Flight Inventory Mobile App

I developed this mobile application using [Google AppSheet](https://cloud.google.com/appsheet); a no-code platform that enables users to build custom apps and automations using data stored in Google Sheets or other sources.

This mobile application is designed to be used on board any flight. It can be used by internal crew with little to no technical experience. The app enables a high-touch, whiteglove approach to service as it automates many of the components of service that require memorization and effort. Crew is allowed to simply focus on delivering a high-class experience to passengers. 

The real advantage of this application is the ability to track and aggregate passenger preference data in an offline data warehouse.

Data can then be used for passenger preference analysis, inventory of goods, and price per flight analysis.
